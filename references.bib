	volume = {18},
	abstract = {In this paper a novel multivariate method is proposed for the analysis of community response data from designed experiments repeatedly sampled in time. The long-term effects of the insecticide chlorpyrifos on the invertebrate community and the dissolved oxygen ({DO)-pH-alkalinity-conductivity} syndrome, in outdoor experimental ditches, are used as example data. The new method, which we have named the principal response curve method ({PRC)}, is based on redundancy analysis ({RDA)}, adjusted for overall changes in community response over time, as observed in control test systems. This allows the method to focus on the time-dependent treatment effects. The principal component is plotted against time, yielding a principal response curve of the community for each treatment. The {PRC} method distills the complexity of time-dependent, community-level effects of pollutants into a graphic form that can be appreciated more readily than the results of other currently available multivariate techniques. The {PRC} method also enables a quantitative interpretation of effects towards the species level.},
