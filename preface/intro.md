## About this book

This book is aimed at students of ecotoxicology and ecotoxicologists who want to learn how to do statistics in their field using the statistical computing platform R.

The book assumes no prior knowlegde in R or programming. 
The first part covers a rather extensive introduction to R. 
This should prepare you follow next chapters on more advanced, specialized topics often encountered in ecotoxicology.
If you are familiar with R, you can skip the first chapter.
If not, please go through every section of this chaper, because the are interlinked.

This book covers nearly no theory and we assume that you are already familiar it. 
If not, please read thee repective sources aimed at ecotoxicologists (like OECD, NEWMAN ---!!!cite!!!---).

The book is intended as a workbook. 
Please type in every command for yourself into R (no copy&paste, no skiping). 
Initially this will be frustrating because of many errors you will produce, but I promise you, these errors make you a better R programmer.
