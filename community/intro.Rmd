## Community Ecotoxicology

We will analyse the pyrifos data set of **van_den_brink_principal_1999** which is shipped with the vegan package.
Twelve experimental ditches were used in this experiment: Four ditches served as control and the remaining eight were treated in duplicates once with in the insecticide chlorpyrifos at doses of 0.1, 0.9, 6 and 44 ug / L. 
Invertebrates were sampled 11 times from week -4 pre-treatment through week 24 post-treatment. A total of 178 taxa were identified, this resulted in a table  of 132 rows (11 * 12 samples) and 178 columns (taxa).
