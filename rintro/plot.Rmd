## Basic Plotting

In this chapter we will explore the basic (but powerful) plotting capabilities of R. 
I later chapters I will also use the plotting system of ggplot [---!!!link!!!---]. 
However, I refer readers to [---!!!link source!!!---] for an introdution to ggplot.


### Plotting the distribution of a variable

First I generate 100 random data points from a N(5, 2) distribution.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
norm_vec <- rnorm(100, 5, 2)
```

One of the best method to plot distributions is a histogramm:

```{r}
hist(norm_vec)
```

Note, that the number of bars is automatically computed by R.
However, we can change this and increase the number of bars to show more details:

```{r}
hist(norm_vec, breaks = 40)
```

or less bars, where we loose information.

```{r}
hist(norm_vec, breaks = 5)
```


Note, freq = FALSE => total area of histogramm is 1
