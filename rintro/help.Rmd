## Getting help

If you're starting with R you will encounter a lot of `Errors`, `Warnings`, `Messages` and other problems.
No one can do programming without errors. This chapter is how and where you can get help.

### R-help

R (and every package) comes with a comprehensive set of help files. Every function needs to have an accompanying help file.
Unfortunately, these help-files are not always easy to read.

You can access the help for every function by preceeding it with a `?`:

```{r rhelp, eval = FALSE}
?mean
```
or by using the search field in the [help pane](../rintro/rstudio.html). This will open this file:

![alt text](../figures/helpfile.png)

These help files always have the same structure (some parts can be missing):

* **Description:** A short description what the function does.

* **Usage:** Here you see all the function arguments.

* **Arguments:** A detailed description of the function arguments.

* **Details:** Usually, mathematical details about the implementation.

* **Value:** What does the function return?

* **Author(s):** Who wrote the function. If you have a question of find a bug you may contact the author.

* **References:** More information about the methods and how to cite them.

* **See Also:** Links to other related functions.

* **Examples:** This is perhabs the most usefull part for a beginner. Here you find examples how the function is used. Copy them into the console and inspect the objects that are passed, what arguments are used and what the output is.

You can also run these examples directly from the terminal with the `?example()` function:

```{r}
example(mean)
```
